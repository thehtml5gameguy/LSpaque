# Types of files
We currently have made .lscript (Because l is funny) and .lpaque (UE uses .pak files so i am using lpaque files)

# lscript
This is a pretty simple interpereted language that runs actions that you can make it do like set object positions,
So it will be pretty easy to make player movement.

# lpaque
lpaque is were you define all of your objects and ui.
